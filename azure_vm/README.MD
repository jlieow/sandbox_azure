### Objective

Terraform used to provision 2 App Registrations with settings to configure one as a Server and Client for OAuth2.0 operation. In addition, it configures an APIM to use the Server as the authorization server to protect its resources.

Server: Resource authorization server. Contains and OAuth scope which controls access to the resources.
CLient: Application authorized by the server to access the resource through the OAuth scope.

### About

This diagram shows a high-level view of the authentication flow. The instructions below will allow us to set a App Registration/Service Principal as a server to expose the API and a client to authenticate to the server and retrieve a token to access the exposed API. In the example below, postman will be used to get the token and call the API.

Instructions to enable OAuth 2.0 for APIM

1. Create App Registration for Server

- App registration > New registration
  - Name = {PROJECT_NAME}-{prod/staging/dev}-001-server
  - Register

- Go into registration’s manifest
  - Set accessTokenAcceptedVersion to 2.
  - Save

- Go into Expose an API
  - Application ID URI > Set > Save
  - Add a scope
    - Scope name = Invoke.API
    - Admin consent display name = Invoke APIs
    - Admin content description = Invoke APIs
    - Add scope

2. Create App Registration for Client

- App registration > New registration
  - Name = {PROJECT_NAME}-{prod/staging/dev}-001-client
  - Register

- Go into registration’s manifest
  - Set accessTokenAcceptedVersion to 2.
  - Save

- Go into API permissions > Add a permission > My APIs
  - Select the App Registration created for server
  - Select the Invoke.API permission
  - Add permissions

- Go into API permissions > Grant admin consent … > Yes. This will grant the permission.

- Go into Certificates & Secrets > New Client Secret
  - Description = Secret
  - Add
  - Save the Secret ID and Secret Value for use later

- Go into Authentication > Add a platform > Web
  - (Optional: Only if you would like to get the token via postman) Redirect URIs = https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback

- Return to the Server App Registration
  - Go into Expose an API > Add a client application
  - Client ID = {CLIENT_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_ID}
  - Checked Authorized scopes option

3. In order to protect an API with OAuth 2.0, go into APIM

- OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect > Add
  - Display Name = {PROJECT_NAME}-{prod/staging/dev}-001-service
  - Client registration page URL = https://localhost
  - Authorization Grant Type = Authorization code, Client credentials
  - Authorization endpoint URL = Client App Registration OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint (v2)
  - Token endpoint URL = Client App Registration OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)
  - Default Scope = api://{SERVER_APP_REGISTRATION_APPLICATION_ID}/API.Invoke
  - Client ID = (CLIENT_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_ID)
  - Client secret = {CLIENT_APP_REGISTRATION_SECRET_VALUE}

- APIs > Select the API you would like to add OAuth 2.0 to > Settings > Security
  - Select {PROJECT_NAME}-{prod/staging/dev}-001-service
  - Save

- APIs > Select the API you would like to add OAuth 2.0 to > Inbound processing > Edit policy

</validate-jwt>
```

4. Optional: Only required if you are using the APIM Developer Portal.) Copy and paste the OAuth 2.0 service redirect URI and paste it into the Client App Registration

- Go into APIM > OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect > Select the just created OAuth 2.0 service
  - Scroll down and select Redirect URI (Note: If this does not work, try the URI in the deprecated portal. The error message would let you know.)
  - Copy the Authorization code grant flow

- Return to the Client App Registration > Authentication > Add a platform > Web
  - Redirect URI = {Paste the OAuth 2.0 service redirect URI Authorization code grant flow}

5. In Postman, create a collection and request. Under either collection or request go to the Authorization tab > Select Type OAuth 2.0

  - Grant Type = Authorization Code
  - Callback URL = https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback
  - Authorize using browser = enabled
  - Auth URL = Server App Registration OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint (v2)
  - Access Token URL = Server App Registration OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)
  - Client ID = {CLIENT_APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_ID}
  - Client Secret = {CLIENT_APP_REGISTRATION_SECRET_VALUE}
  - Scope = {SERVER_APP_REGISTRATION_API_PERMISSION_SCOPE}
  - Get New Access Token
  - Use the token to call the API
